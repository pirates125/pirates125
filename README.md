## Hi, I'M Kaan. 👀

## Who am I ?

I'm 25 years old and I'm from Turkey but I prefer to say earthling 🌱. I generally prefer silence, daydreaming, and observation, and I act accordingly. I place great importance on my inner world and practice daily how to be a better friend to myself. Because I believe that someone who is a good friend to themselves loves everything, in every sense. Another thing I love is analyzing what I observe and acting with a plan. I build everything, absolutely everything, with meticulous attention to detail and rationality. This fuels my developmental spirit, and that's why I gravitated towards the software field. I brought my inherent qualities and intuitive mind to the keyboard, to code, to logic. For the next step, I invite you to read the following articles to understand what I value in technology. See you there.

## So, What do I do ?

My goal in every project I develop is not to have code that screams and looks like mud, but rather to have a guide that speaks, explains the logic, shows the picture and illuminates everything. My working principle is as follows;

- Everything should be clear, simple, and understandable.
- Code should be able to express itself without shouting.
- If a structure doesn't flow flawlessly, it doesn't work.
- Errors aren't hidden; they are made visible and managed.
- To understand a system, its flows must be known in advance.
- Unnecessary complexity is the enemy of good design.
- Software is the expression of the mind; the more organized the thought, the more organized the code.

And now I'd like to invite the technologies I use to the stage. With your permission;

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack

- Node.js  
- TypeScript  
- Express  
- PostgreSQL  
- Docker  
- Git  

### **Principles & Practices**
- Clean Architecture  
- Error-First Design  
- Flow-Oriented System Thinking  
- Modularity  
- Testing (Unit / Integration – Jest)

### **Currently Deepening**
- Go  
- Redis  
- System Design  
- Message Brokers (Kafka / RabbitMQ)

Now I invite the projects I have developed to the stage.

## 📌 My projects

### 📚 Library Authorization System *(continues)* 

I'm practically developing my understanding of role-based authority management, clear flow design, seamless error management, and modular architecture.

This project provides practical answers to questions like:

- "How do I think about a system?"
- "How do I build a system?"
- "How do I make errors visible?"


*(I will add details as the project is completed.)*
